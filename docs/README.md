# Anjani's Personal Website
> Welcome! You've reached the space that I use to share my work with the world.

## About Me

I am a Computational Linguist with a background in engineering, data analytics, and financial services. I have previous expertise in data product creation and management, financial data (specifically in consumer credit card / retail banking), and team management. I have just completed a masters in Computational Linguistics at UCL (c/o 2025) and am looking to re-enter the workplace with the new knowledge I have in NLP research.

Get in touch! I love to chat about natural language/linguistics, NLP, data, and numbers. My email is anjani.ganapathy@gmail.com.
